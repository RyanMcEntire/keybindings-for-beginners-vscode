# Keybindings For Beginners

Using a few keybindings can make coding a much more comfortable experience, especially if you are using a track pad on a laptop, and much more ergonomic if you have to constantly reach for a mouse, taking your hands on and off the keyboard.

Use this as a reference to help you remember some keybindings that will make your life easier.

##### WORK IN PROGRESS

This isn't a comprehensive reference for all shortcuts. For that, I suggest [this reference pdf.](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf)

Instead, this aims to be a starting place to try out a few useful shortcuts to mix into your workflow. The shortcuts are grouped into levels, based on how useful and frequently they can be used to save you time. Level 1 shortcuts are quite useful and can be used often.
